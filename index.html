          <h3>Custom Builds</h3>
          <p>
            For all custom PCs, you must come to me with a maximum budget in mind(over $700) or I will not work with you. I take serious inquiries ONLY and a basic build runs at least $550 for components alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a budget in mind, and are ready to begin your build planning process, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me at my business email below with your name, preferred google email for contact, budget, and your Venmo or Cashapp username. </p>
          <p>Once I am ready to begin your build, I will send a request for $25 to your account and I will email you a list of questions to answer about yourself, your PC, and your budget. </p>
          <p>Once I recieve payment and information on the build, I will put together a complete purchasing guide with product info, pricing, purchasing links, and warranty information, which I will send to your preferred contact method. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are satisfied with the parts list, and would like to continue with the build process, you may begin purchasing parts from the list along with any applicable warranties(please confirm substitutes for out of stock items with me*). </p>
          <p>Once you have purchased all parts, you will bring everything to my home office (For in-person builds only*), along with a $50 (non-refundable) deposit for any work I may have put in prior to a pre-mature pickup. Online builds will continue via discord or facetime. Ask about these options if you are interested in a self installation process or would like to continue with another PC builder. 
          </p>
          <p>
            After dropoff, I will begin putting together the PC build while documenting my progress via pictures, videos, and sometimes livestreams on Kick, Twitch, or Discord.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall build process usually takes less than 24 hours to complete, but can take longer depending on volume and complexity of the individual build. I will inform you when the build is ready for pickup and send photos of the finished product along with any necessary documentation such as benchmarks, scores, and performance reviews, to your preferred contact method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, once I recieve payment for the completed build, I will send you a reciept and copy of the build guide for your future reference, and you may come pick up the final product at my home office at your earliest convenience.

          <li>
            If at any point I run into a fatal problem (part that is dead on arrival, incompatibility issues due to you purchasing a part not on the parts list, or used components malfunctioning or missing parts), I will send you a summary of the problems and how to fix them, and you will have the option to leave the PC with me while you replace broken components for an additional $5/day storage fee, or you can pick up the PC in the meantime for as long as it takes you to replace the broken parts, at which point you can bring the build and all parts back and I can continue working. 
          </li><br>
          <li>
            If at any point after the build has physically begun, you decide to no longer continue with the build process and take it elsewhere, or you decide to postpone the build process beyond a reasonable time period (3 months), I reserve the right to cancel the build entirely with no refund of your build deposit. 
          </li><br>
          <li>All services priced by the hour have a 1 hour minimum and any additional time will be charged by the full hour (1:03 session == 2:00 session).</li>
